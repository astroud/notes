"Our brains need some way to mark forward movement in the things that matter to us. When our work is hard for others to observe, we can struggle"

So "how can we feel that sense of progress when our work...is mostly invisible?"

[1] Break big goals into microtasks

Writing your high-level goal, why it’s important to you, and five small tasks with realistic achieve-by dates (dates can create a sense of urgency). Checking these tasks off can give you a dopamine hit, motivating you.


[2] Find a way to mark progress

"Creating your own process for documenting tasks and checking them off is helpful…for anybody who’s doing intangible work."

If you’re still not feeling motivated after tracking progress on microtasks, "it’s possible the progress you made didn’t feel meaningful."

"Ask yourself: What’s driving you…Really spend some time with this question; it might help you identify which work tasks—especially the tiny ones—can give you that meaningful sense of progress."
 
"The tasks you want to check off, or the outcomes you want to work toward, don’t have to be significant to others. They just need to feel meaningful to you." 
 
"Figure out what’s meaningful for you—no matter how small—to give yourself the glorious gift of dopamine as you tick those boxes."
 
[3] Celebrate progress with others
Even if this idea doesn't immediately appeal to you, don't discard it out of hand. There's lots of ways to celebrate with others. For ex, I've found the @CodeBookClub community immensely useful. /thread
