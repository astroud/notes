# Notes

Dev and professional notes that may be useful to others


## Why I take notes
I'm a long-time note taker, bookmarker, and keeper of [swipe files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swipe_file). I take notes to help me remember and as a reference in the times when I do not remember. I've found that I will often remember that I've encountered a challenge before but cannot recall the solution. Searching my notes is far faster than [DuckDuckGo'ing](http://duckduckgo.com) for the answer (googling is my fallback).


I am also trying to get better at following [swyx's](http://swyx.io) adviceâ€”if it's worth reading, it's worth taking notes on. 


## Tools I Use
I am a *huge* fan of [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) which is no longer maintained. Fortunately, NV has a spiritual successor: [nvUltra](http://nvultra.com). The NV approach to note storage consists of folder(s) of markdown files with an interface for *rapidly* searching or creating new notes.

Notes can be interlinked and you can add tags in a note's body or their filenames. I prefer tags in the file names like this:

```
Reference - Tips - OmniFocus - Ideas to try.md
```


Because all of my notes exist as markdown files, there's no lock-in or fear of losing access to my notes when the internet goes down or when a company fails.

I've recently taken to using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for longer notes, but I still generally use nvUltra to locate answers (nvu is faster + better interface). Obsidian's interface shares a lot of DNA with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so much so that I find myself missing many of my favorite vsc shortcuts.

I also bookmark and tag everything that looks even remotely useful for the future. When I'm ready to start a new project, my bookmarks are often one of the first places I start.

I've used [Pinboard ](http://pinboard.in) for over a decade. Pinboard is essentially [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) ðŸª¦, except well managed. 

## Buckets of Notes
Originally I started with one bucket of notes. Overtime, I decided to split the notes into *personal* and *professional.* With this repo I've created a third category: *Professionalâ€”and possibly useful to others*.

Over time, I may migrate more Professional notes into this repo, but it is my intention for this repo to be my default bucket for new notes.
